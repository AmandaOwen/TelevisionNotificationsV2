This application is an attempt to refine and extend the previous television notification app I created. 

Plans for this app: 
1. Check UK TV listings via the Radio Times dat feeds.  * Existing functionality, being refined.
2. Allow users to find a new series by typing its name. * Existing functionality, being refined.
3. Allow users to find a list of upcoming new series.   * Existing functionality, being refined.
4. Allow users to schedule an email to let them know when a new series is due. 
5. Allow users to schedule an email to let them know if a "Monitored" series changes timeslot.
